## Content Testing

The main objective of content testing is to validate User Experience, i.e., the purpose is not to check whether the reader ‘likes’ the written content, but to ensure that it provides them appropriate and suitable information, which is written accurately and is readable, understandable, and helpful.

As content is a crucial part of understanding, learning, and getting to know the services and products provided by an organisation, it is extremely necessary for them to test it properly. With the assistance of content testing, one can gain perspective on content quality, presentation, and format.
